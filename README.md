# XCursion
WDIR - Project 3: Travel Tracker

XCursion is a web application that allows you to track the places you've been to and the places you want to go to. After creating an account, users have the ability to add places to their "Want To" and "Been To" lists, or even copy other user's places onto one of their two lists. Other app features include searching through all public posts in the Home page, editing and deleting any of your created posts, and adding images and descriptions to your posts.


## Getting Started

Start by registering your account. To view an example user's account and features, use the login information below.
```
username: spaceghost
password: spaceghost
```

### Pre-Requisites, Installation and Tests

No installation is needed to run the app. A user must simply register and login.

## Updates and Future Goals
In the week we had to create this app, we were able to implement a lot of our initial plans and stretch goals, though with more time there are a few more things we'd like to add.

* **Like button functionality** - *At the moment, the like button is displayed, but it has not functionality. We'd like to allow users to like other people's posts once, or be able to unlike them.*
* **User Profile** - *The app has a social media aspect since you can see other user's posts and copy them, and in the future like them. We would like to add more to that social media aspect by creating user profiles. This would also give users the ability to update their information.*
* **Forgot Password** - *A really useful functionality we would like to add in the future is an option to email users a new temporary password or implementing some other option that allows them to log in if they've forgotten their password.*
