# XCursion
WDIR - Project 3: Travel Tracker

XCursion is a web application that allows you to track the places you've been to and the places you want to go to. After creating an account, users have the ability to add places to their "Want To" and "Been To" lists, or even copy other user's places onto one of their two lists. Other app features include searching through all public posts in the Home page, editing and deleting any of your created posts, and adding images and descriptions to your posts.


## Getting Started

Start by registering your account. To view an example user's pages and workouts, use the login information below.
